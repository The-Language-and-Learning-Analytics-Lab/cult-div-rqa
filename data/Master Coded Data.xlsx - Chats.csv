I also think that cell reception is very important especially if people need to call for rides after or order Ubers . That venue also has outdoor seating options which is great if the party has older people who cannot be near load music for long periods of time. That venue also offers vegetarian options which a lot of venues usually don't offer. Overall I feel like it's a little more inclusive.
